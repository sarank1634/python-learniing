python commands: -

variables 
python has no command for declaring a variable.

if you want to specify the data type of variable  this can be done with casting .
 exa
 X = str(3)    # x will be '3'

 single or Double quotes are the same
 x = "hello world"
 y = 'hello world'
 
variables are case sensitive
x = 5
X = 6
